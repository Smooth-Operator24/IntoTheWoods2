        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        
        <p>
            Our story began with a love for nature — the kind that calms your spirit, brightens your day, and makes any space feel like home. Surrounded by the rush of modern life, we wanted to create places where people could slow down, breathe deeply, and reconnect with the beauty of the natural world.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            What started as a small idea — adding a touch of green to simple spaces — soon grew into a passion for designing interiors that feel alive. Every piece we create, from lush indoor plants to handcrafted décor, is chosen with care, inspired by the gentle textures, colors, and patterns found in nature.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We believe that true beauty lies in simplicity and authenticity. Our work celebrates natural materials, earthy tones, and the quiet elegance of greenery. Each design tells a story — one that brings warmth, comfort, and a sense of belonging to your home or workspace.
        </p>

        <p>
            At INTO THE WOODS, we don’t just decorate interiors — we nurture spaces where nature and people thrive together. Because when we live close to nature, we live closer to ourselves.
